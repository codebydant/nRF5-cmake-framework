# nRF5 CMake Framework
This is a CMake project to program a **nRF52832 board** using CMake 3.16.0, JLink, NRFJProgrammer and NRF5 SDK 16.0. The CMake files are taken from: https://github.com/Polidea/cmake-nRF5x and https://github.com/JF002/nrf52-baseproject for reference.

## How to compile
1. Download:
	
	* gcc arm none eabi toolchain x86-64-linux: https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
	* SDK for the nRF52 16.0: https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download#infotabs
	* Programmer NRFJPROG: https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs
	* JLink: https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack

2. Create a folder in /opt to unzip files, e.g. */opt/SEGGER/*
3. Change lines **19**,**20**,**21** and **22** in the *CMakeLists.txt* file at the root project with the path for each one (toolchain,SDK and Programmer) and save it.
	e.g. 

		set(NRF_TARGET 	"nrf52")							  # nrf51 or nrf52
		set(ARM_NONE_EABI_TOOLCHAIN_PATH "/opt/SEGGER/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major") # Path to root folder 
		set(NRF5_SDK_PATH "/opt/SEGGER/nRF5SDK"	)					  # Path to root folder
		set(NRFJPROG "/opt/SEGGER/Toolchain/nrfjprog/nrfjprog")				  # Path to .bin file

4. Create a *build* folder and,
	
		$ cd build/	
		$ cmake ../	

	If everything is good, you should see something like this, e.g.

		-- The C compiler identification is GNU 5.4.0
		-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 5.4.0
		-- The ASM compiler identification is GNU
		-- Found assembler: /usr/bin/cc
		-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc
		-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc -- works
		-- Detecting C compiler ABI info
		-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
		-- Detecting C compile features
		-- Detecting C compile features - done
		-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++
		-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works
		-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
		-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
		-- Detecting CXX compile features
		-- Detecting CXX compile features - done
		-- Configuring done
		-- Generating done
		-- Build files have been written to: /home/xXx/Downloads/nRF5-cmake-framework-master/build

5. Compile with make:
	
		$ make

	e.g.

		[ 91%] Linking C executable application-example.out
		post build steps for application-example
		   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
		   8800	    172	    884	   9856	   2680	application-example.out

		[ 95%] Built target FLASH_SOFTDEVICE
		Scanning dependencies of target FLASH_ERASE

		Erasing user available code and UICR flash areas.
		Applying system reset.
		[ 97%] Built target FLASH_ERASE
		Scanning dependencies of target START_JLINK
		[100%] started JLink commands
		[100%] Built target START_JLINK

## How to run monitor
At the root folder run,

		$ ./monitor
		
This assume that the JLink binaries are on */opt/SEGGER/JLink/* if not, you should modify the *runJLinkEXE-nrf52* on the *RTT* folder.

## How to add new SDK libraries
You have to comment-uncomment these lines in order to include a SDK library in the *CMakeLists.txt* file.

		nRF5x_setup()
		# nRF5x_addAppScheduler()
		# nRF5x_addAppFIFO()
		nRF5x_addAppTimer()
		# nRF5x_addAppUART()
		nRF5x_addAppButton()
		nRF5x_addBSP(TRUE FALSE FALSE) # (btn atn_btn nfc)
		nRF5x_addBLEGATT()
		# nRF5x_addBLEService(ble_bas)
		# nRF5x_addNFC()
		nRF5x_addAppFDS()
		nRF5x_addBLEPeerManager()
		# nRF5x_addBLEAdvertising()
		# nRF5x_addAppFIFO()
		
or,

		include_directories(
			"${NRF5_SDK_PATH}/<library header directory path>"
		)

		list(APPEND SDK_SOURCE_FILES
			"${NRF5_SDK_PATH}/<library source file path>"
		)

## How to use as your own project
Just modify the *main.c* file with your own code. In case you need specify more SDK libraries you have to modify the *nrF5x.cmake* file on the *cmake* folder.
